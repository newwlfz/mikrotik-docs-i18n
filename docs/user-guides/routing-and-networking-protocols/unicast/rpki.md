# RPKI

> RouterOS supports RPKI for BGP prefix validation using the Resource Public Key Infrastructure, enabling secure route origin verification via RTR protocol. Configuration includes setting up RTR servers and applying filters based on RPKI validity status to accept or reject routes.

# RPKI

RouterOS implements the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to Router Protocol defined in [`RFC 8210`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8210). RTR is a lightweight, low-memory protocol for retrieving prefix validation data from RPKI validators. See a validator setup example on the [RIPE blog](https://blog.apnic.net/2019/10/28/how-to-installing-an-rpki-validator/).

Configuration is available under [`/routing/rpki`](../../../cli-reference/routing/rpki.md#routingrpki).

## Basic Example

Assume your network has an RTR server at IP address `192.168.1.1`:

```ros
/routing/rpki
add group=myRpkiGroup address=192.168.1.1 port=8282 refresh-interval=20
```

The [`group`](../../../cli-reference/routing/rpki.md#group), [`address`](../../../cli-reference/routing/rpki.md#address), [`port`](../../../cli-reference/routing/rpki.md#port), and [`refresh-interval`](../../../cli-reference/routing/rpki.md#refresh-interval) parameters configure the RTR connection. Additional parameters include [`vrf`](../../../cli-reference/routing/rpki.md#vrf), [`preference`](../../../cli-reference/routing/rpki.md#preference), [`retry-interval`](../../../cli-reference/routing/rpki.md#retry-interval), and [`expire-interval`](../../../cli-reference/routing/rpki.md#expire-interval).

After the connection is established and the validator database is received, check prefix validity using [`rpki-check`](../../../cli-reference/routing/rpki.md#routingrpkirpki-check):

```text
[admin@rack1_b33_CCR1036] /routing/rpki> rpki-check group=myRpkiGroup prfx=70.132.18.0/24 origin-as=16509
    valid
```

Use the cached database in [routing filters](../route-selection-and-filtering.md) to accept or reject prefixes based on RPKI validity. First set up a [`/routing/filter/rule`](../../../cli-reference/routing/filter.md#routingfilterrule) that defines which RPKI group performs verification. After that, filters can match the status from the RPKI database. Status can have one of four values:

- **valid** - Database has a record and origin AS is valid.
- **invalid** - The database has a record and origin AS is invalid.
- **unknown** - The database does not have information about the prefix and origin AS.
- **unverified** - Set when none of the RPKI group's sessions has synced the database. Use this value to handle total RPKI failure.

```ros
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=bgp_in rule="rpki-verify myRpkiGroup"
add chain=bgp_in rule="if (rpki invalid) { reject } else { accept }"
```
