# L2TP

This section covers L2TP examples. Use it to configure LAC and LNS scenarios and related L2TP interoperability cases.

<DocCardList />

Layer Two Tunneling Protocol "L2TP" extends the PPP model by allowing the L2 and PPP endpoints to reside on different devices interconnected by a packet-switched network.  L2TP includes PPP authentication and accounting for each L2TP connection. Full authentication and accounting of each connection may be done through a RADIUS client or locally. L2TP traffic uses UDP protocol for both control and data packets. UDP port 1701 is used only for link establishment, further traffic is using any available UDP port (which may or may not be 1701). This means that L2TP can be used with most firewalls and routers (even with NAT) by enabling UDP traffic to be routed through the firewall or router.  The L2TP standard is defined in [RFC 2661](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2661). The L2TPv3 support was added in version 7.1. It supports IPv4 and IPv6.

## Introduction

It may be useful to use L2TP just as any other tunneling protocol with or without encryption. The L2TP standard says that the most secure way to encrypt data is using L2TP over IPsec (Note that it is the default mode for the Microsoft L2TP client) as all L2TP control and data packets for a particular tunnel appear as homogeneous UDP/IP data packets to the IPsec system.

Multilink PPP (MP) is supported in order to provide MRRU (the ability to transmit full-sized 1500 and larger packets) and bridging over PPP links (using Bridge Control Protocol (BCP) that allows sending raw Ethernet frames over PPP links). This way it is possible to set up bridging without EoIP. The bridge should either have an administratively set MAC address or an Ethernet-like interface in it, as PPP links do not have MAC addresses.

:::warning
L2TP does not provide encryption mechanisms for tunneled traffic. IPsec can be used for additional security layers.

| **add-default-route** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Whether to add L2TP remote address as a default route. |
| **allow** (*mschap2 \| mschap1 \| chap \| pap*; Default: **mschap2, mschap1, chap, pap**) | Allowed authentication methods. |
| **connect-to** (*IP\|IPv6*; Default: ) | Remote address of L2TP server (if the address is in the VRF table,  VRF should be specified)  `/interface/l2tp-client``add connect-to=192.168.88.1@vrf1 name=l2tp-out1 user=l2tp-client)`    |
| **comment** (*string*; Default: ) | Short description of the tunnel. |
| **default-route-distance** (*byte*; Default: ) | Since v6.2, sets distance value applied to the auto-created default route, if add-default-route is also selected |
| **dial-on-demand** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | Connects only when outbound traffic is generated. If selected, then a route with gateway address from 10.112.112.0/24 network will be added while the connection is not established. |
| **disabled** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Enables/disables the tunnel. |
| **keepalive-timeout** (*integer [1..4294967295]*; Default: **60s**) | Since v6.0rc13, tunnel keepalive timeout in seconds. |

| **mrru** (*disabled \| integer*; Default: **disabled**) | Maximum packet size that can be received on the link. If a packet is bigger than tunnel MTU, it will be split into multiple packets, allowing full size IP or Ethernet packets to be sent over the tunnel. |

## L2TP Server

An interface is created for each tunnel that is established to the given server. There are two types of interfaces in the L2TP server's configuration:

- Static interfaces are added administratively if there is a need to reference the particular interface name (in firewall rules or elsewhere) created for the particular user.
- Dynamic interfaces are added to this list automatically whenever a user is connected and its username does not match any existing static entry (or in case the entry is active already, as there cannot be two separate tunnel interfaces referenced by the same name).

Dynamic interfaces appear when a user connects and disappear once the user disconnects, so it is impossible to reference the tunnel created for that user in the router configuration (for example, in the firewall), so if you need persistent rules for that user, create a static entry for him/her. Otherwise, it is safe to use a dynamic configuration.

:::warning
In both cases PPP users must be configured properly - static entries do not replace PPP configuration.

## Quick Example

### L2TP Server

On the server side we will enable L2TP-server and create a PPP profile for a particular user:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/l2tp-server/server/set enabled=yes
[admin@MikroTik] > /ppp/secret/add local-address=10.0.0.2 name=MT-User password=StrongPass profile=default-encryption remote-address=10.0.0.1 service=l2tp
```

### L2TP Client

L2TP client setup in RouterOS is very simple.  In the following example, we already have a preconfigured 3 unit setup. We will take a more detailed look at how to set up an L2TP client with username "MT-User", password "StrongPass" and server 192.168.51.3:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/l2tp-client \
add connect-to=192.168.51.3 disabled=no name=MT-User password=StrongPass user=MT-User
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/l2tp-client/print 
Flags: X - disabled, R - running 
0 R name="MT-User" max-mtu=1450 max-mru=1450 mrru=disabled connect-to=192.168.51.3 user="MT-User" 
password="StrongPass" profile=default-encryption keepalive-timeout=60 use-ipsec=no ipsec-secret="" 
allow-fast-path=no add-default-route=no dial-on-demand=no allow=pap,chap,mschap1,mschap2
```

## L2TP Ether

## Overview

Layer 2 Tunnel Protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3) is defined by [RFC 3931](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3931) from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It introduces various improvements to the original L2TP, allowing the encapsulation of Layer 2 (L2) payloads within L2TP. More precisely, L2TPv3 outlines the protocol for tunnelling Layer 2 payloads across an IP core network using L2 virtual private networks (VPNs).

To establish an **L2TP Ether** tunnel, the **L2TP Ether interface** must be created on the **client side**, while the **L2TP server** must be enabled on the **remote (server) side**. Once both sides are configured correctly, a **dynamic interface** is automatically created between them, forming a transparent Layer 2 connection across the IP network.
