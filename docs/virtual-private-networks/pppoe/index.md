# PPPoE

> PPPoE enables IPv6 prefix delegation over PPP and MLPPP across Ethernet links, supporting both client-to-server and server-to-client configurations. It operates in discovery and session phases, with LCP/CHAP authentication and IPCP for IP address assignment. MTU considerations ensure proper encapsulation, while client properties like authentication methods and demand dialing enhance flexibility.

# PPPoE

This section covers PPPoE examples. Use it to configure IPv6 prefix delegation over PPP and MLPPP over one or more links.

<DocCardList />

Point to Point over Ethernet (PPPoE) is simply a method of encapsulating PPP packets into Ethernet frames. PPPoE is an extension of the standard Point to Point Protocol (PPP) and it is the successor of PPPoA. PPPoE standard is defined in [RFC 2516](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2516). The PPPoE client and server work over any Layer2 Ethernet level interface on the router, for example, Wireless, Ethernet, EoIP, etc. Generally speaking, PPPoE is used to hand out IP addresses to clients based on authentication by username (and also if required, by workstation) as opposed to workstation only authentication where static IP addresses or DHCP are used. It is advised not to use static IP addresses or DHCP on the same interfaces as PPPoE for obvious security reasons.

## Introduction

PPPoE provides the ability to connect a network of hosts over a simple bridging access device to a remote Access Concentrator.

Supported connections:

- MikroTik RouterOS PPPoE client to any PPPoE server.
- MikroTik RouterOS server (access concentrator) to multiple PPPoE clients (clients are available for almost all operating systems and most routers).

## PPPoE Operation

PPPoE has two distinct stages (phases):

1. Discovery phase.
2. Session phase.

### Discovery phase

There are four steps to the Discovery stage. When it completes, both peers know the PPPoE *SESSION\_ID* and the peer's Ethernet address, which together define the PPPoE session uniquely:

1. **PPPoE Active Discovery Initialization (PADI) -** The PPPoE client sends out a *PADI* packet to the broadcast address. This packet can also populate the "service-name" field if a service name has been entered in the dial-up networking properties of the PPPoE client. If a service name has not been entered, this field is not populated.
2. **PPPoE Active Discovery Offer (PADO) -** The PPPoE server, or Access Concentrator, should respond to the *PADI* with a *PADO* if the Access Concentrator is able to service the "service-name" field that had been listed in the *PADI* packet. If no "service-name" field had been listed, the Access Concentrator will respond with a *PADO* packet that has the "service-name" field populated with the service names that the Access Concentrator can service. The *PADO* packet is sent to the unicast address of the PPPoE client.
3. **PPPoE Active Discovery Request (PADR) -** When a *PADO* packet is received, the PPPoE client responds with a *PADR* packet. This packet is sent to the unicast address of the Access Concentrator. The client may receive multiple *PADO* packets, but the client responds to the first valid *PADO* that the client receives. If the initial *PADI* packet had a blank "service-name" field, the client populates the "service-name" field of the *PADR* packet with the first service name that had been returned in the *PADO* packet.
4. **PPPoE Active Discovery Session Confirmation (PADS) -** When the *PADR* is received, the Access Concentrator generates a unique session identification (ID) for the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) session and returns this ID to the PPPoE client in the *PADS* packet. This packet is sent to the unicast address of the client.

### PPPoE session termination

- **PPPoE Active Discovery Terminate (PADT) -** Can be sent anytime after a session is established to indicate that a PPPoE session has been terminated. It can be sent by either server or client.

### Session phase

When the discovery stage is completed, both peers know the *PPPoE Session ID* and the other peer's *Ethernet (MAC) address* which together define the PPPoE session. PPP frames are encapsulated in PPPoE session frames, which have Ethernet frame type **0x8864**.
When a server sends confirmation and a client receives it, the PPP Session is started that consists of the following stages:

1. **LCP negotiation** stage.
2. **Authentication (CHAP/PAP)** stage.
3. **IPCP negotiation** stage - where the client is assigned an IP address.

:::warning
If any process fails, the LCP negotiation establishment phase is started again.
:::

The PPPoE server sends *Echo-Request* packets to the client to determine the state of the session, otherwise, the server will not be able to determine that the session is terminated in cases when a client terminates the session without sending a *Terminate-Request* packet.

## MTU

Typically, the largest Ethernet frame that can be transmitted without fragmentation is 1500 bytes. PPPoE adds another 6 bytes of overhead and the PPP field adds two more bytes, leaving 1492 bytes for an IP datagram. Therefore max PPPoE MRU and MTU values must not be larger than 1492.

TCP stacks try to avoid fragmentation, so they use an MSS (Maximum Segment Size). By default, MSS is chosen as the MTU of the outgoing interface minus the usual size of the TCP and IP headers (40 bytes), which results in 1460 bytes for an Ethernet interface. Unfortunately, there may be intermediate links with lower MTU which will cause fragmentation. In such a case the TCP stack performs path MTU discovery. Routers that cannot forward the datagram without fragmentation are supposed to drop the packet and send *ICMP-Fragmentation-Required* to the originating host. When a host receives such an ICMP packet, it tries to lower the MTU. This should work in the ideal world; however, in the real world many routers do not generate fragmentation-required datagrams; also, many firewalls drop all ICMP datagrams.

The workaround for this problem is to [adjust MSS](../../firewall-and-quality-of-service/firewall/mangle.md#change-mss) if it is too big.

#### Available read only properties

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **service** (*string*) | Service name configured on the server |
| **mac-address** (*MAC*) | Mac address of the detected server |
| **ac-name** (*string*) | Name of the Access Concentrator |

:::warning
For Windows, some connection instructions may use the form where the "phone number", such as "MikroTik\_AC\mt1", is specified to indicate that "MikroTik\_AC" is the access concentrator name and "mt1" is the service name.

**Warning:** Specifying MRRU means enabling MP (Multilink PPP) over a single link. This protocol is used to split big packets into smaller ones. Under Windows, it can be enabled in the Networking tab, Settings button, "Negotiate multi-link for single link connections". MRRU is hardcoded to 1614 on Windows. This setting is useful to overcome PathMTU discovery failures. The MP setting should be enabled on both peers.

## PPPoE Server

There are two types of interface (tunnel) items in PPPoE server configuration - static users and dynamic connections. An interface is created for each tunnel established to the given server. Static interfaces are added administratively if there is a need to reference the particular interface name (in firewall rules or elsewhere) created for the particular user. Dynamic interfaces are added to this list automatically whenever a user is connected and the user's username does not match any existing static entry (or in case the entry is active already, as there can not be two separate tunnel interfaces referenced by the same name - set the *one-session-per-host* value if this is a problem). Dynamic interfaces appear when a user connects and disappear once the user disconnects, so it is impossible to reference the tunnel created for that user in the router configuration (for example, in firewall), so if you need a persistent rule for that user, create a static entry for him/her. Otherwise, it is safe to use a dynamic configuration.

:::warning
In both cases PPP users must be configured properly - static entries do not replace PPP configuration.

### Access concentrator

**Sub-menu:** `/interface/pppoe-server/server`

#### Properties

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **accept-untagged** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | This setting controls whether the PPPoE server will accept untagged (non-VLAN) PPPoE packets on its interface, when `pppoe-over-vlan-range` is specified.  By default, untagged PPPoE packets are accepted. If you are using the `pppoe-over-vlan-range` property (which enables PPPoE over 802.1Q VLANs), this option lets you decide whether to still allow untagged clients on the same interface. If you are not using the `pppoe-over-vlan-range`, this setting does not have any effect. |
| **authentication** ( *mschap2 \| mschap1 \| chap \| pap*; Default: **"mschap2, mschap1, chap, pap"**) | Authentication algorithm. |
| **default-profile** (*string*; Default: **"default"**) |  |
| **interface** (*string*; Default: **""**) | Interface that the clients are connected to. |
| **keepalive-timeout** (*time*; Default: **"10", or disabled**) | Defines the time period (in seconds) after which the router is starting to send keepalive packets every second. If there is no traffic and no keepalive responses arrive for that period of time (i.e. 2 \* keepalive-timeout), the non-responding client is proclaimed disconnected. **Important:** After a successful LCP handshake, the client sends LCP echo packets to verify MTU forwarding; if no reply is received, it falls back to a backup MTU of 1480. A new option, `keepalive-timeout=disabled`, disables sending echo packets, effectively turning off the MTU test.     |
| **max-mru** (*integer*; Default: **1480**) | Maximum Receive Unit. The optimal value is the MTU of the interface the tunnel is working over reduced by 20 (so, for 1500-byte Ethernet link, set the MTU to 1480 to avoid fragmentation of packets) |
| **max-mtu** (*integer*; Default: **1480**) | Maximum Transmission Unit. The optimal value is the MTU of the interface the tunnel is working over reduced by 20 (so, for 1500-byte Ethernet link, set the MTU to 1480 to avoid fragmentation of packets) |
| **max-sessions** (*integer*; Default: **"0"**) | Maximum number of clients that the AC can serve. '0' = no limitations. |
| **mrru** (*integer: 512..65535 \| disabled*; Default: **"disabled"**) | Maximum packet size that can be received on the link. If a packet is bigger than tunnel MTU, it will be split into multiple packets, allowing full size IP or Ethernet packets to be sent over the tunnel. |
| **one-session-per-host** (*yes \| no*; Default: **"no"**) | Allow only one session per host (determined by MAC address). If a host tries to establish a new session, the old one will be closed. |
| **pppoe-over-vlan-range** (*integer 1..4094*; Default: "") | This setting allows a PPPoE server to operate over 802.1Q VLANs. By default, a PPPoE server only accepts untagged packets on its interface. However, in scenarios where clients are on separate VLANs, instead of creating multiple 802.1Q VLAN interfaces and bridging them together or configuring individual PPPoE servers for each VLAN, you can specify the necessary VLANs directly in the PPPoE server settings.  When you specify the VLAN IDs, the PPPoE server will accept 802.1Q tagged packets from clients, and it will reply using the same VLAN. You then have an option to accept or drop untagged PPPoE clients on the same interface using the `accept-untagged` property.  You can configure the PPPoE server with `pppoe-over-vlan-range` setting even on [VLAN interface](../../bridging-and-switching/vlan.md) enabling the QinQ setups as well. But keep in mind that the inner VLAN tag should be 802.1Q.  The setting supports a range of VLAN IDs, as well as individual VLANs specified using comma-separated values. For example: pppoe-over-vlan-range=100-115,120,122,128-130. **Caution:** Avoid configuring a server with `pppoe-over-vlan-range` on an interface while also creating a VLAN interface using a VLAN ID that falls within that range. For example:  `/interface/vlan``add interface=ether2 name=vlan15 vlan-id=15``/interface/pppoe-server/server``add disabled=no interface=ether2 pppoe-over-vlan-range=10-20`  If you need this type of setup, remove the overlapping VLAN ID from `pppoe-over-vlan-range` and create a separate PPPoE server instance directly on the VLAN interface, like this:  `/interface/vlan``add interface=ether2 name=vlan15 vlan-id=15``/interface/pppoe-server/server``add disabled=no interface=ether2 pppoe-over-vlan-range=10-14,16-20``add disabled=no interface=vlan15`    |
| **service-name** (*string*; Default: **""**) | The PPPoE service name. Server will accept clients that send a PADI message with service-names that match this setting or if the service-name field in the PADI message is not set. |

The PPPoE server (access concentrator) supports multiple servers for each interface - with differing service names. The access concentrator name and PPPoE service name are used by clients to identify the access concentrator to register with. The access concentrator name is the same as the identity of the router displayed before the command prompt. The identity may be set within the *`/system/identity`* submenu.

:::danger
Do not assign an IP address to the interface you will be receiving the PPPoE requests on.
:::

Specifying MRRU means enabling MP (Multilink PPP) over a single link. This protocol is used to split big packets into smaller ones.  The MRRU is hardcoded to 1614. This setting is useful to overcome PathMTU discovery failures. The MP setting should be enabled on both peers.

:::warning
The default *keepalive-timeout* value of 10s is OK in most cases. If you set it to 0, the router will not disconnect clients until they explicitly log out or the router is restarted. To resolve this problem, the one-session-per-host property can be used.

### PPPoE Client

To configure MikroTik RouterOS to be a PPPoE client, just add a PPPoE-client with the following parameters as in the example:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > interface pppoe-client add interface=ether2 password=StrongPass service-name=pppoeservice name=PPPoE-Out disabled=no user=MT-User
[admin@MikroTik] > interface pppoe-client print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, R - running 
 0  R name="PPPoE-Out" max-mtu=auto max-mru=auto mrru=disabled interface=ether2 user="MT-User" 
      password="StrongPass" profile=default keepalive-timeout=10 service-name="pppoeservice" ac-name="" 
      add-default-route=no dial-on-demand=no use-peer-dns=no allow=pap,chap,mschap1,mschap2
```

### PPPoE Server

To configure MikroTik RouterOS to be an Access Concentrator (PPPoE Server):

- add an IP address pool for the clients from 10.0.0.2-10.0.0.5.
- add a PPP profile.
- add a PPP secret (username/password).
- add the PPPoE server itself.

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip/pool
add name=pppoe-pool ranges=10.0.0.2-10.0.0.5
[admin@MikroTik] > /ppp/profile
add local-address=10.0.0.1 name=for-pppoe remote-address=pppoe-pool
[admin@MikroTik] > /ppp/secret
add name=MT-User password=StrongPass profile=for-pppoe service=pppoe
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface/pppoe-server/server
add default-profile=for-pppoe disabled=no interface=ether3 service-name=pppoeservice
```

## Notes

It's not recommended to use a large amount of pppoe-clients on one device.
