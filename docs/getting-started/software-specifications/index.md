# Software Specifications

#### Hardware Support

**MikroTik made devices:** RouterOS is compatible with MikroTik hardware it comes preinstalled on. Even older, discontinued MikroTik devices can run the latest RouterOS, but it's important to note that the performance may vary. There are a few exceptions to this for the very oldest product lines. The latest RouterOS v7 is not compatible with all MIPS-LE family of devices (such as RB100 series, some RB700 series devices etc., please check the architecture of the device in question). In short, there is no set limit on software compatibility or upgrades. Even devices that are no longer manufactured for 20 years may still receive software updates, as long as they have enough RAM and are not based on a MIPS-LE CPU.

**3rd party devices:** RouterOS can also be run on 3rd party devices if they meet the following requirements:

- x86 or AMPERE powered ARM CPU.
- Minimum 64MB of RAM.
- IDE, SATA, USB, and flash storage medium with a minimum of 64MB of space.
- Network cards supported by the Linux kernel.

:::info
**Note:** NVMe storage is supported only for CHR, x86, Tile, and MMIPS architectures. For specific information, please look at each product brochure or block diagram.

:::info
**Note:** RouterOS 7 with default configuration requires at least 32MB of RAM, but for more advanced configuration, we suggest at least 64MB.
