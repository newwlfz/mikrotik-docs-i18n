# Watchdog

> The Watchdog page in RouterOS configuration allows setting up system reboots triggered by unresponsive IP addresses or software lockups, with options for ping monitoring and automatic support output file generation via email.

# Watchdog

**Sub-menu:** `/system/watchdog`

This menu allows configuring the system to reboot, when a specific IP address does not respond, or when it detects that the software has locked up. The detection is done in two ways:

- Software watchdog timer (mostly caused by hardware malfunction): the device can recover itself with a reboot.
- Ping watchdog can monitor connectivity to a specific IP address and trigger the reboot function.

:::info
**Note:** These are two different Watchdog features and both have their own settings. By default software Watchdog is enabled and ping Watchdog is disabled. You can enable ping Watchdog by specifying an IP address and you can disable the software Watchdog by unsetting the Watchdog Timer option.

**Important:** **Note:** Watchdog reboot is not a system failure. Such a reboot also will not generate an autosupout file. Watchdog reboot is `/system/reboot` automatically triggered by the operating system when some service is not responding as fast as it should. Reasons for that can vary among damaged hardware, slow software implementation for some service, DDoS attack, bad configuration and others.

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **auto-send-supout** (*yes \| no*; Default: **no**) | After the support output file is automatically generated, it can be sent by email. |
| **automatic-supout** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | When software failure happens, a file named "autosupout.rif" is generated automatically. The previous "autosupout.rif" file is renamed to "autosupout.old.rif". |
| **no-ping-delay** (*time*; Default: 5m) | Specifies how long it will wait before trying to reach the watch-address. |
| **ping-timeout** (*time*; Default: 60s) | Specifies the time interval in which the device will be pinged 6 times (after "no-ping-delay"). |
| **send-email-from** (*string*; Default: ) | The e-mail address to send the support output file from. If not set, the value set in `/tool/e-mail` is used. |
| **send-email-to** (*string*; Default: ) | The e-mail address to send the support output file to. |
| **send-smtp-server** (*string*; Default: ) | SMTP server address to send the support output file through. If not set, the value set in `/tool/e-mail` is used. |
| **watch-address** (*IP*; Default: ) | The system will reboot, in case 6 sequential pings to the given IP address fail. If set to none, this feature is disabled. By default, the router will reboot every 6 minutes if the watch-address is set and not reachable. |
| **watchdog-timer** (*yes \| no*; Default: **yes**) | Whether to reboot if a system is unresponsive for a minute. |

## Quick Example

To make the system generate a support output file and send it automatically to support@example.com through the 192.0.2.1 in case of a software crash:

```ros
[admin@MikroTik] /system/watchdog/set auto-send-supout=yes \
\... send-email-to=support@example.com send-smtp-server=192.0.2.1
[admin@MikroTik] /system/watchdog> print
      watch-address: none
     watchdog-timer: yes
      no-ping-delay: 5m
   automatic-supout: yes
   auto-send-supout: yes
   send-smtp-server: 192.0.2.1
      send-email-to: support@example.com
```
