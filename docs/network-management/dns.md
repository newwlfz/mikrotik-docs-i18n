> This page introduces DNS functionality in MikroTik RouterOS, explaining how to configure the router as a DNS cache or primary server with options for remote requests, caching policies, and dynamic server integration. It details configuration properties like cache size, TTL settings, and DNS over HTTPS (DoH) support.

# DNS

## Introduction

Domain Name System (DNS) usually refers to the phonebook of the Internet. In other words, DNS is a database that links strings (known as hostnames), such as [mikrotik.com](https://mikrotik.com) to a specific IP address, such as 159.148.172.205 or 2a02:610:7501:2000::205

A MikroTik router with a DNS feature enabled can be set as a DNS cache for any DNS-compliant client. Moreover, a MikroTik router can be specified as a primary DNS server under its DHCP server settings. When remote requests are enabled, a MikroTik router responds to TCP and UDP DNS requests on port 53.

When both static and dynamic servers are set, static server entries are preferred, however, it does not indicate that a static server will always be used (for example, previously a query was received from a dynamic server, but static was added later, then a dynamic entry will be preferred).

:::tip
When the DNS server *allow-remote-requests* is used make sure that you limit access to your server over TCP and UDP protocol port 53 only for known hosts.

:::

There are several options on how you can manage DNS functionality on your LAN - use public DNS, use the router as a cache, or do not interfere with DNS configuration. Let us take as an example the following setup: Internet service provider (ISP) → Gateway (GW) → Local area network (LAN). The GW is a RouterOS based device with the default configuration:

- You do not configure any DNS servers on the "GW" DHCP server network configuration - the device will forward the DNS server IP address configuration received from `ISP` to `LAN` devices.
- You configure DNS servers on the "GW" DHCP server network configuration - the device will give configured DNS servers to `LAN` devices (also "/ip/dns/set allow-remote-requests=yes*" must* be enabled).
- "dns-none" is configured under DNS servers on the "GW" DHCP server network configuration - the device will not forward any of the **dynamic** DNS servers to `LAN` devices.

### DNS configuration

The DNS facility is used to provide domain name resolution for the router itself as well as for the clients connected to it.

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **allow-remote-requests** (*yes* \| *no*; Default: **no**) | Specifies whether to allow router usage as a DNS cache for remote clients. Otherwise, only the router itself will use DNS configuration. |
| **address-list-extra-time** *(time; Default: **0s**)* | Extra time added to TTL when creating an address list entry. |
| **cache-max-ttl** (*time*; Default: **1w**) | Maximum time-to-live for cache records. In other words, cache records will expire unconditionally after cache-max-TTL time. Shorter TTLs received from DNS servers are respected. |
| **cache-size** (*integer[64..4294967295]*; Default: **2048**) | Specifies the size of the DNS cache in KiB. |
| **max-concurrent-queries** (*integer*; Default: **100**) | Specifies how many concurrent queries are allowed. |
| **max-concurrent-tcp-sessions** (*integer*; Default: **20**) | Specifies how many concurrent TCP sessions are allowed. |
| **max-udp-packet-size** (*integer [50..65507]*; Default: **4096**) | Maximum size of an allowed UDP packet. |
| **mdns-repeat-ifaces** (*list of interfaces*; Default: ) | Once an interface in this list receives an mDNS packet, it will forward it to all other interfaces in this list. Only supports IPv4. |
| **query-server-timeout** (*time*; Default: **2s**) | Specifies how long to wait for a query response from a server. |
| **query-total-timeout** (*time*; Default: **10s**) | Specifies how long to wait for a query response in total. Note that this setting must be configured taking into account "query-server-timeout" and the number of used DNS servers. |
| **servers** (*list of IPv4/IPv6 addresses@vrf*; Default: ) | List of DNS server IPv4/IPv6 addresses |
| **cache-used** (*integer*) | Shows the currently used cache size in KiB |
| **dynamic-server** (*IPv4/IPv6 list*) | List of dynamically added DNS servers from different services, for example, DHCP. |
| **doh-max-concurrent-queries** (*integer*; Default: **50**) | Specifies how many DoH concurrent queries are allowed. |
| **doh-max-server-connections** (*integer*; Default: **5**) | Specifies how many concurrent connections to the DoH server are allowed. |
| **doh-timeout** (*time*; Default: **5s**) | Specifies how long to wait for a query response from the DoH server. |
| **use-doh-server** (*string; Default: )* | Specifies which DoH server must be used for DNS queries. DoH functionality overrides "*servers*" usage if specified. The server must be specified with an "https://" prefix. Supports only one DoH server. |
| **verify-doh-cert** (*yes* \| *no*; Default: **no**) | Specifies whether to validate the DoH server, when one is being used. Will use the "/certificate" list in order to verify server validity. |
| **vrf** (vrf; Default: main) | Specifies the VRF that should use the DNS resolver. The DNS resolver processes only requests originating from the designated VRF or from the resolver itself. |

              dynamic-servers: 10.155.0.1

         query-server-timeout: 2s
          query-total-timeout: 10s
       max-concurrent-queries: 100
  max-concurrent-tcp-sessions: 20
                   cache-size: 2048KiB
                cache-max-ttl: 1d
                   cache-used: 48KiB
```

Dynamic DNS servers are obtained from different facilities available in RouterOS, for example, DHCP client, VPN client, IPv6 Router Advertisements, etc.

Servers are processed in a queue order - static servers as an ordered list, dynamic servers as an ordered list. When the DNS cache has to send a request to the server, it tries servers one by one until one of them responds. After that this server is used for all types of DNS requests. The same server is used for any types of DNS requests, for example, A and AAAA types. If you use only dynamic servers, then the DNS returned results can change after reboot, because servers can be loaded into IP/DNS settings in a different order due to different speeds on how they are received from facilities mentioned above.

If at some point the server which was being used becomes unavailable and can not provide DNS answers, then the DNS cache restarts the DNS server lookup process and goes through the list of specified servers once more.

### DNS Cache

This menu provides two lists with DNS records stored on the server:

- *"*`/ip/dns/cache`*"*: this menu provides a list of cached DNS entries that RouterOS cache can reply with to client requests;
- *"*`/ip/dns/cache/all`*"*: This menu provides a complete list of all cached DNS records stored including also, for example, PTR records.

:::tip
You can empty the DNS cache with the command: `/ip/dns/cache/flush`.

:::

### DNS Static

The MikroTik RouterOS DNS cache has an additional embedded DNS server feature that allows you to configure multiple types of DNS entries that can be used by the DNS clients using the router as their DNS server. This feature can also be used to provide false DNS information to your network clients. For example, it can resolve any DNS request for a certain set of domains (or for the whole Internet) to your own page.

```text
[admin@MikroTik] /ip/dns/static/add name=www.mikrotik.com address=10.0.0.1

```

The server is also capable of resolving DNS requests based on basic regular expressions so that multiple requests can be matched with the same entry. In case an entry does not conform to DNS naming standards, it is considered a regular expression. The list is ordered and checked from top to bottom. Regular expressions are checked first, then the plain records.

Use regex to match DNS requests:

```text
[admin@MikroTik] /ip/dns/static/add regexp=".*mikrotik.*" address=10.0.0.2
```

If DNS static entries list matches the requested domain name, then the router will assume that this router is responsible for any type of DNS request for the particular name. For example, if there is only an "A" record in the list, but the router receives an "AAAA" request, then it will reply with an "A" record from the static list and will query the upstream server for the "AAAA" record. If a record exists, then the reply will be forwarded. If not, then the router will reply with an "ok" DNS reply without any records in it. If you want to override domain name records from the upstream server with unusable records, then you can, for example, add a static entry for the particular domain name and specify a dummy IPv6 address for it "::ffff".

List all of the configured DNS entries as an ordered list:

```text
[admin@MikroTik] /ip/dns/static/print 
Columns: NAME, REGEXP, ADDRESS, TTL
# NAME             REGEXP       ADDRESS   TTL
0 www.mikrotik.com               10.0.0.1  1d 
1                  [*mikrotik*]  10.0.0.2  1d
```

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **address** (*IPv4/IPv6*) | The address that will be used for "A" or "AAAA" type records. |
| **cname**(*string**)* | Alias name for a domain name. |
| **forward-to** | The IP address of a domain name server to which a particular DNS request must be forwarded. |
| **mx-exchange** (*string*) | The domain name of the MX server. |
| **name** (*string)* | Domain name. |
| **srv-port** (*integer*; Default: 0) | The TCP or UDP port on which the service is to be found. |
| **srv-target** | The canonical hostname of the machine providing the service ends in a dot. |
| **text** (*string**)* | Textual information about the domain name. |
| **type**(*A* \| *AAAA* \| *CNAME* \| *FWD* \| *MX* \| *NS* \| *NXDOMAIN* \| *SRV* \| *TXT* ; Default: *A*) | Type of the DNS record. |
| **address-list** (*string**)* | Name of the Firewall address list to which the address must be dynamically added when some request matches the entry. The entry will be removed from the address list when TTL expires. |
| **comment**(*string**)* | Comment about the domain name record. |
| **disabled** (*yes* \| *no*; Default: yes) | Whether the DNS record is active. |
| **match-subdomain** (*yes* \| *no*; Default: no) | Whether the record will match requests for subdomains. |
| **mx-preference** (*integer*; Default: 0) | Preference of the particular MX record. |
| **ns**(*string*) | Name of the authoritative domain name server for the particular record. |
| **regexp** (regex) | Regular expression against which domain names should be verified. |
| **srv-priority** (*integer*; Default: 0) | Priority of the particular SRV record. |
| **srv-weight** (*integer*; Default: 0) | Weight of the particular SRV record. |
| **ttl** (*time*; Default: *24h*) | Maximum time-to-live for cached records. |

:::info
For each static A and AAAA record, in cache automatically is added a PTR record.

:::

:::warning
Regexp is case-sensitive, but DNS requests are not case sensitive, so RouterOS converts DNS names to lowercase before matching any static entries. You should write regex only with lowercase letters. Regular expression matching is significantly slower than plain text entries, so it is advised to minimize the number of regular expression rules and optimize the expressions themselves.

:::

:::warning
Be careful when you configure regex through mixed user interfaces - CLI and GUI. Adding the entry itself might require escape characters when added from CLI. It is recommended to add an entry and execute the print command in order to verify that regex was not changed during addition.

:::

## DNS over HTTPS (DoH)

RouterOS supports DNS over HTTPS (DoH). DoH uses the HTTPS protocol to send and receive DNS requests for better data integrity. The main goal is to provide privacy by eliminating "man-in-the-middle" attacks (MITM).

[Video: DoH setup](http://youtube.com/watch?v=w4erB0VzyIE)

Configure the DoH server:

```ros
/ip/dns/set use-doh-server=DoH_Server_Query_URL verify-doh-cert=yes
```

:::info
It is possible to use [built in certificate authorities store](../authentication-authorization-accounting/certificates.md#built-in-trust-store-authorities) for DoH server certificate validation without need to manually import the relevant root certificate.
:::

:::info
Only one DoH server is supported.

:::

Note that you need at least one regular DNS server configured for the router to resolve the DoH hostname itself.

```ros
/ip/dns/set servers=1.1.1.1
```

If you do not have any dynamic or static DNS server configured, add a static DNS entry for the DoH server domain name like this:

```ros
/ip/dns/static/add address=IP_Address name=Domain_Name
```

:::tip
If a DoH server is being used (the DoH DNS name can be resolved) then it will be the only DNS service working at the time and standard DNS servers from the IP/DNS servers list will not be used.

:::

:::tip
If *`/certificate/settings/set` crl-use* is set to *yes,* RouterOS will check CRL for each certificate in a certificate chain, therefore, an entire certificate chain should be installed into a device - starting from Root CA, intermediate CAs (if there are any), and the certificate that is used for a specific service.

For example, Google DoH, Cloudflare, and OpenDNS full chains contain three certificates, NextDNS has four certificates.

:::
:::info
The ARM64, x86, and CHR devices negotiate HTTP/2 when communicating with a DoH server. If the server supports it, the router uses HTTP/2 for DNS over HTTPS queries, providing improved multiplexing and reduced latency compared to HTTP/1.1. If either side lacks HTTP/2 support, the connection falls back to HTTP/1.1.

:::

### Known compatible/incompatible DoH services

#### Compatible DoH services

- Cloudflare
- Google
- NextDNS
- OpenDNS

#### Incompatible DoH services

- Yandex
- UncensoredDNS
- Quad9

## Adlist

Adlist is an integral component of network-level ad blocking, comprising a curated collection of domain names known for serving advertisements. This feature operates by utilizing Domain Name System (DNS) resolution to intercept A and AAAA requests to these domains. When a client device queries a DNS server for a domain listed on the adlist, the DNS resolution process is altered. Instead of returning the actual IP address of the ad-serving domain, the DNS server responds with the IP address 0.0.0.0. This effectively null-routes the request, as 0.0.0.0 is a non-routable meta-address used to denote an invalid, unknown, or non-applicable target. By redirecting ad-related requests in this manner, the adlist feature ensures that advertisement content is not loaded, enhancing network performance and improving the user experience by reducing unwanted ad traffic.

[Video: Adlist setup](http://youtube.com/watch?v=RMJnjyAOfLI)

:::warning
**Before configuring, increase the DNS cache as it's used to store adlist entries. If the limit is reached, an error in the DNS,error topic is printed "*adlist read: max cache size reached*"**

:::

:::warning
Adlist is stored on the device's internal memory. Ensure that there is enough free space to save the desired adlist.

:::

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| url | Used to specify the URL of an adlist. |
| ssl-verify | Specifies whether to validate the SSL certificate of the Adlist URL server.   It will use the "/certificate" list to verify server validity. |
| match-count | Count of matched DNS name requests. |
| name-count | Count of DNS names imported from the Adlist. |
| file | Used to specify a local file path from which to read adlist data. |
| pause | Temporarily pause the use of all adlists. |
| reload | Checks for updates for all lists, if updates are found, the list is updated, removing or adding entries as needed, the lists are not redownloaded in full when issuing a reload, instead only necessary updates are done. **Important:** It's not mandatory to use reload to update the lists, Adlist checks for new updates once every four hours.     |

### Whitelist for Adlist

To exempt certain domains from Adlist, you need to create a static DNS FWD entry, for example, `/ip/dns/static/add name=bar.test type=FWD`, if such an entry is present, the query will be answered by the router if it has a relevant static DNS entry `/ip/dns/static/add name=bar.test type=A`, or alternatively, if no static rule is present, forwarded to the next DNS, either dynamic or one configured under `/ip/dns/set servers=`, FWD entries are supported by DoH as well.

### Configuration examples

#### URL based adlist

```ros
/ip/dns/adlist/add url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts ssl-verify=no
```

To see how many domain names are present and matched, you can run:

```ros
/ip/dns/adlist/print 
Flags: X - disabled 
0 url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts" ssl-verify=no match-count=122 name-count=164769

```

#### Locally hosted adlist

To create your adlist, you can create a text file with the domains. Example:

```
0.0.0.0 example1.com
0.0.0.0 eu1.example.com
0.0.0.0 ex.com
0.0.0.0 com.example.com
```

:::info
You can create the txt file on your PC, but it is also possible to create it in RouterOS, with the following commands

"/file/add name=host.txt", and then you can run "/file/edit host.txt contents" after adding entries. Press "ctrl o" to save the entries.

:::

To add a file to adlist:

```ros
/ip/dns/adlist/add file=host.txt

```

:::info
You can verify that the file is formatted correctly with `/ip/dns/adlist/print`, the results will show how many hostnames you have added, the hostname format must match the format given in the previous example.

:::

```ros
/ip/dns/adlist/print 
Flags: X - disabled 
 0   file=host.txt match-count=0 name-count=4 
```

## Forwarders

DNS Forwarders allows a user to configure a named DNS forwarder that can be used for static FWD entries as a *forward-to* value.

For each *Forwarder*, it is possible to configure multiple regular upstream and DoH servers. Configured *forwarder* servers will be used by round-robin algorithm - for each query, the next server will be used to resolve DNS name.

### Forwarder configuration

In *`/ip/dns/forwarders`* section, *forwarders* can be added, modified or removed.

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **name** (*string;* Default: ) | Forwarder name. |
| **dns-servers** (*string*; Default: ) | An IP address or a DNS name of a domain name server. Can contain multiple records, for example, *dns-servers=1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8,local.dns* |
| **doh-servers**(*string;* Default: ) | A URL of a DoH server. Can contain multiple records. |
| **verify-doh-cert** (*yes* \| *no**;* Default: *yes*) | Specifies whether to validate the DoH server, when one is being used. It will use the "/certificate" list in order to verify server validity. |

### Configuration example

Configure/add a *forwarder*:

```routeros
/ip/dns/forwarders
add dns-servers=1.1.1.1,local.dns doh-servers=https://dns.google/dns-query name=forwarder1
```

Configure/add a static DNS FWD entry:

```routeros
/ip/dns/static
add forward-to=forwarder1 name=mikrotik.com type=FWD
```

Now each time when a router receives a request to resolve [mikrotik.com](http://mikrotik.com), the request using a round-robin algorithm will be forwarded to *1.1.1.1*, *local.dns* or *Google DoH* server.

## mDNS

RouterOS supports [Multicast DNS (mDNS)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762) for local network service discovery. By default, mDNS operates within a single subnet. The mDNS repeater feature allows extending mDNS functionality across different interfaces or VLANs using the "mdns-repeat-ifaces" property.

### Impact of using mDNS Repeater

- Cross-Subnet Service Discovery: Devices on different subnets or VLANs can discover each other, enhancing the ability to find services (e.g., printers, file sharing).
- Increased Network Traffic: mDNS repeater may increase multicast traffic, which could lead to congestion, especially in larger networks with many devices.

The mDNS repeater is commonly used with devices such as:

- Apple Ecosystem (AirPrint, AirPlay).
- Smart Home Devices (Thread, IoT).
- Chromecast and Media Streaming.
- Avahi (Linux/Unix).

To enable the mDNS repeater between interfaces, allowing devices connected to these interfaces to discover each other using mDNS, use the following command:

```routeros
/ip/dns/set mdns-repeat-ifaces=<interface1>,<interface2>
```

:::info
mDNS repeater requires multicast-capable interfaces (e.g., Ethernet, VLAN, bridge). Tunnel interfaces such as WireGuard are not supported.

Currently only IPv4 is supported.

:::

:::warning
MikroTik mDNS Repeater is a local service intercepting multicast packets to rebroadcast them. It requires an "input" rule. mDNS multicast traffic does not traverse the "forward" chain. In case you have strict firewall rules protecting your router from local subnets, you must explicitly allow mDNS traffic before any drop - allowed to receive UDP port 5353 traffic on the "input" chain.
